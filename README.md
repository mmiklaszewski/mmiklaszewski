# CV-APP

CV-APP is an application based on PHP (8.3) and the Symfony (6.4) framework. The project enables browsing my CV and using the AI Reviewer, which generates a description of the title and provides an assessment of whether it aligns with user preferences.

To create the project, I used Docker, the OpenAI GPT 3.5 model, and the Serper.dev search engine.
